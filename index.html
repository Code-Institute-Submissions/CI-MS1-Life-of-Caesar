          This is a reproduction of an important piece of history. On this site, you'll find reproduced the full text of
          a nearly 2000 year old biography of Julius Caesar, as well as further links to learn about the life of this

          Why read about Caesar?
        </h3><br>
        <p class="col-style">
          Because it's FUN! The main purpose of this page is to make history not just accesible to you, but also
          exciting and relatable. What I want you to take away from this site is not answers, but questions about a
          period two millenia in the past and yet so similar to our own!<br>
          <br>
          If you find the text of Suetonius history hard to read, don't panic. This was written 2000 years ago and aimed
          for an audience that spoke a different language, from a culture that is incredibly different to our modern day
          sensibilities. Instead of focusing on what makes it different, focus on what you recognize as similar to our
          own time and you'll find yourself sucked into the story soon enough!

          Who are you?
        </h3><br>
        <p>
          I am an enthusiast of ancient history, in particular the history of the Roman empire.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have been obsessed with ancient history since at age 9 my parents made the mistake of letting me stay up
          late one night to watch the BBC production of "I, Claudius"! Since then, I've had an insatiable desire to
          learn more about Rome and roman history.
          <br>
          <br>
          I've studied archaeology, antique studies and history at Stockholm
          university and consider myself well-read on the topic enough to guide beginnners, even though I am not a
          publishing academic. This site is my attempt to inspire that same desire to learn more about the period in
          you!
