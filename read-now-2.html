            <h1>Ch XVI:</h1>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, when Caecilius Metellus, tribune of the commons, brought forward some bills of a
                highly seditious nature in spite of the veto of his colleagues, Caesar abetted him and espoused his
                cause in the stubbornest fashion, until at last both were suspended from the exercise of their public
                functions by a decree of the senate. Yet in spite of this Caesar had the audacity to continue in office
                and to hold court; but when he learned that some were ready to stop him by force of arms, he dismissed
                his lictors, laid aside his robe of office, and slipped off privily to his house, intending to remain in
                retirement because of the state of the times. 2 Indeed, when the populace on the following day flocked
                to him quite of their own accord, and with riotous p21 demonstrations offered him their aid in
                recovering his position, he held them in check. Since this action of his was wholly unexpected, the
                senate, which had been hurriedly convoked to take action about that very gathering, publicly thanked him
                through its leading men; then summoning him to the House and lauding him in the strongest terms, they
                rescinded their former decree and restored him to his rank.

            <p>
                He again fell into danger by being named among the accomplices of Catiline, both before the
                commissioner Novius Niger by an informer called Lucius Vettius and in the senate by Quintus Curius,
                who had been voted a sum of money from the public funds as the first to disclose the plans of the
                conspirators. Curius alleged that his information came directly from Catiline, while Vettius actually
                offered to produce a letter to Catiline in Caesar's handwriting. But Caesar, thinking that such an
                indignity could in no wise be endured, showed by appealing to Cicero's testimony that he had of his own
                accord reported to the consul certain details of the plot, and thus prevented Curius from getting the
                reward. As for Vettius, after his bond was declared forfeit and his goods seized, he was roughly handled
                by the populace assembled before the rostra, and all but torn to pieces. Caesar then put him in prison,
                and Novius the commissioner went there too, for allowing an official of superior rank to be arraigned
                before his tribunal.

            <h1>Ch XVIII:</h1>
            <p>
                Being allotted the province of Farther Spain after his praetorship, Caesar got rid of his creditors, who
                tried to detain him, by means of sureties and contrary both to precedent and law was on his way
                before the provinces were provided for; possibly through fear of a private impeachment or perhaps to
                respond more promptly to the entreaties of our allies for help. After restoring order in his province,
                he made off with equal haste, and without waiting for the arrival of his successor, to sue at the same
                time for a triumph and the consulship. But inasmuch as the day for the elections had already been
                announced and no account be taken of Caesar's candidacy unless he entered the city as a private citizen,
                and since his intrigues to gain exemption from the laws met with general protest, he was forced to forgo
                the triumph, to avoid losing the consulship.
            </p>

        <div class="chapter" id="ch-19">

            <h1>Ch XIX:</h1>
            <p>
                Of the two other candidates for this office, Lucius Lucceius and Marcus Bibulus, Caesar joined forces
                with the former, making a bargain with him that since Lucceius had less influence but more funds, he
                should in their common name promise largess to the electors from his own pocket. When this became known,
                the aristocracy authorized Bibulus to promise the same amount, being seized with fear that Caesar would
                stick at nothing when he became chief magistrate, if he had a colleague who was heart and soul with him.
                Many of them contributed to the fund, and even Cato did not deny that bribery under such circumstances
                was for the good of the commonwealth.
                <br>
                So Caesar was chosen consul with Bibulus. With the same motives the aristocracy took care that provinces
                of the smallest importance should be assigned to the newly elected consuls; that is, mere woods and
                pastures. Thereupon Caesar, especially incensed by this slight, by every possible attention courted
                the goodwill of Gnaeus Pompeius, who was at odds with the senate because of its tardiness in
                ratifying his acts after his victory over king Mithridates. He also patched up a peace between Pompeius
                and Marcus Crassus, who had been enemies since their consulship, which had been one of constant
                wrangling. Then he made a compact with both of them, that no step should be taken in public affairs
                which did not suit any one of the three.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter" id="ch-20">

            <h1>Ch XX:</h1>
            <p>
                Caesar's very first enactment after becoming consul was, that the proceedings both of the senate and of
                the people should day by day be compiled and published. He also revived a by-gone custom, that during
                the months when he did not have the fasces an orderly should walk before him, while the lictors followed
                him. He brought forward an agrarian law too, and when his colleague announced adverse omens, he
                resorted to arms and drove him from the Forum; and when next day Bibulus made complaint in the senate
                and no one could be found who ventured to make a motion, or even to express an opinion about so
                high-handed a proceeding (although decrees had often been passed touching less serious breaches of the
                peace), Caesar's conduct drove him to such a pitch of desperation, that from that time until the end of
                his term he did not leave his house, but merely issued proclamations announcing adverse omens.
                <br>
                From that time on Caesar managed all the affairs of state alone and after his own pleasure; so that
                sundry witty fellows, pretending by way of jest to sign and seal testamentary documents,17 wrote "Done
                in the consulship of Julius and Caesar," instead of "Bibulus and Caesar," writing down p27 the same man
                twice, by name and by surname. Presently too the following verses were on everyone's lips:—
                <br>
                "In Caesar's year, not Bibulus', an act took place of late;
                For naught do I remember done in Bibulus' consulate."
                <br>
                The plain called Stellas, which had been devoted to public uses by the men of by-gone days, and the
                Campanian territory, which had been reserved to pay revenues for the aid of the government, he divided
                without casting lots among twenty thousand citizens who had three or more children each. When the
                publicans asked for relief, he freed them from a third part of their obligation, and openly warned them
                in contracting for taxes in the future not to bid too recklessly. He freely granted everything else that
                anyone took it into his head to ask, either without opposition or by intimidating anyone who tried to
                object.
                <br>
                Marcus Cato, who tried to delay proceedings, was dragged from the House by a lictor at
                Caesar's command and taken off to prison. When Lucius Lucullus was somewhat too outspoken in his
                opposition, he filled him with such fear of malicious prosecution, that Lucullus actually fell on his
                knees before him. Because Cicero, while pleading in court, deplored the times, Caesar transferred the
                orator's enemy Publius Clodius that very same day from the patricians to the plebeians, a thing for
                which Clodius had for a long time been vainly striving; and that too at the ninth hour. Finally
                taking action against all the opposition in a body, he bribed an informer to declare that he had been
                egged on by certain men to murder Pompey, and to come out upon the rostra and name the guilty
                parties according to a prearranged plot. But when the informer had named one or two to no purpose and
                not without suspicion of double-dealing, Caesar, hopeless of the success of his over-hasty attempt, is
                supposed to have had him taken off by poison.

            <h1>Ch XXI:</h1>
            <p>
                At about the same time he took to wife Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Piso, who was to succeed him in the
                consulship, and affianced his own daughter Julia to Gnaeus Pompeius, breaking a previous engagement with
                Servilius Caepio, although the latter had shortly before rendered him conspicuous service in his contest
                with Bibulus.
                <br>
                And after this new alliance he began to call upon Pompey first to give his opinion in the
                senate, although it had been his habit to begin with Crassus, and it was the rule for the consul in
                calling for opinions to continue throughout the year the order which he had established on the Kalends
                of January.

                Backed therefore by his father-in law and son-in law, out of all the numerous provinces he made the
                Gauls his choice, as the most likely to enrich him and furnish suitable material for triumphs. At first,
                it is true, by the bill of Vatinius he received only Cisalpine Gaul with the addition of Illyricum; but
                presently he was assigned Gallia Comata as well by the senate, since the members feared that even if
                they should refuse it, the people would give him this also. Transported with joy at this success, he
                could not keep from boasting a few days later before a crowded house, that having gained his heart's
                desire to the grief and lamentation of his opponents, he would therefore from that time mount on
                their heads; and when someone insultingly remarked that that would be no easy matter for any woman, he
                replied in the same vein that Semiramis too had been queen in Syria and the Amazons in days of old had
                held sway over a great part of Asia.

            <h1>Ch XXXIII:</h1>
            <p>
                When at the close of his consulship the praetors Gaius Memmius and Lucius Domitius moved an inquiry into
                his conduct during the previous year, Caesar laid the matter before the senate; and when they failed to
                take it up, and three days had been wasted in fruitless wrangling, went off to his province. Whereupon
                his quaestor was at once arraigned on several counts, as a preliminary to his own impeachment. Presently
                he himself too was prosecuted by Lucius Antistius, tribune of the commons, and it was only by appealing
                to the whole college that he contrived not to be brought to trial, on the ground that he was absent on
                public service. Then to secure himself for the future, he took great pains always to put the
                magistrates for the year under personal obligation, and not to aid any candidates or suffer any to be
                elected, save such as guaranteed to defend him in his absence. And he did not hesitate in some cases to
                exact an oath to keep this pledge or even a written contract.

        <div class="chapter" id="ch-24">

            <h1>Ch XXIV:</h1>
            <p>
                When however Lucius Domitius, candidate for the consulship, openly threatened to effect as consul what
                he had been unable to do as praetor, and to take his armies from him, Caesar compelled Pompeius and
                Crassus to come to Luca, a city in his province, where he prevailed on them to stand for a second
                consulship, to defeat Domitius; and he also succeeded through their influence in having his term as
                governor of Gaul made five years longer. Encouraged by this, he added to the legions which he had
                received from the state others at his own cost, one actually composed of men of Transalpine Gaul and
                bearing a Gallic name too (for it was called Alauda), which he trained in the Roman tactics and
                equipped with Roman arms; and later on he gave every man of it citizenship. After that he did not let
                slip any pretext for war, however unjust and dangerous it might be, picking quarrels as well with
                allied, as with hostile and barbarous nations; so that once the senate decreed that a commission be sent
                to inquire into the condition of the Gallic provinces, and some even recommended that Caesar be handed
                over to the enemy. But as his enterprises prospered, thanksgivings were appointed in his honour oftener
                and for longer periods than for anyone before his time.

                During the nine years of his command this is in substance what he did. All that part of Gaul which is
                bounded by the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Cévennes, and by the Rhine and Rhone rivers, a circuit of some
                20024 miles, with the exception of some allied states which had rendered him good service, he reduced
                to the form of a province; and imposed upon it a yearly tribute of 40,000,000 sesterces. He was the
                first Roman to build a bridge and attack the Germans beyond the Rhine; and he inflicted heavy losses
                upon them. He invaded the Britons too, a people unknown before, vanquished them, and exacted moneys
                and hostages. Amid all these successes he met with adverse fortune but three times in all: in Britain,
                where his fleet narrowly escaped destruction in a violent storm; in Gaul, when one of his legions was
                routed at Gergovia; and on the borders of Germany, when his lieutenants Titurius and Aurunculeius were
                ambushed and slain.

                Within this same space of time he lost first his mother, then his daughter, and soon afterwards his
                grandchild. Meanwhile, as the community was aghast at the murder of Publius Clodius, the senate had
                voted that only one consul should be chosen, and expressly named Gnaeus Pompeius. When the tribunes
                planned to make him Pompey's colleague, Caesar urged them rather to propose to the people that he be
                permitted to stand for a second consulship without coming to Rome, when the term of his governorship
                drew near its end, to prevent his being forced for the sake of the office to leave his province
                prematurely and without finishing the war. On the granting of this, aiming still higher and flushed
                with hope, he neglected nothing in the way of lavish expenditure or of favours to anyone, either in his
                public capacity or privately.
                <br>
                He began a forum with the proceeds of his spoils, the ground for which
                cost more than a hundred million sesterces. He announced a combat of gladiators and a feast for the
                people in memory of his daughter, a thing quite without precedent. To raise the expectation of these
                events to the highest possible pitch, he had the material for the banquet prepared in part by his own
                household, although he had let contracts to the markets as well. He gave orders that whenever
                famous gladiators fought without winning the favour of the people, they should be rescued by force and
                kept for him.
                <br>
                He had the novices trained, not in a gladiatorial school by professionals, but in private
                houses by Roman knights and even by senators who were skilled in arms, earnestly beseeching them, as is
                shown by his own letters, to give the recruits individual attention and personally direct their
                exercises. He doubled the pay of the legions for all time. Whenever grain was plentiful, he distributed
                it to them without stint or measure, and now and then gave each man a slave from among the captives.

                Moreover, to retain his relationship and friendship with Pompey, Caesar offered him his sister's
                granddaughter Octavia in marriage, although she was already the wife of Gaius Marcellus, and asked for
                the hand of Pompey's daughter, who was promised to Faustus Sulla. When he had put all Pompey's friends
                under obligation, as well as the greater part of the senate, through loans made without interest or at a
                low rate, he lavished gifts on men of all other classes, both those whom he invited to accept his bounty
                and those who applied to him unasked, including even freedmen and slaves who were special favourites of
                their masters or patrons. In short, he was the sole and ever ready help of all who were in legal
                difficulties or in debt and of young spendthrifts, excepting only those whose burden of guilt or poverty
                was so heavy, or who were so given up to riotous living, that even he could not save them; and to these
                he declared in the plainest terms that what they needed was a civil war.

                He took no less pains to win the devotion of princes and provinces all over the world, offering
                prisoners to some by the thousand as a gift, and sending auxiliary troops to the aid of others whenever
                they wished, and as often as they wished, without the sanction of the senate or people, besides adorning
                the principal cities of Asia and Greece with magnificent public works, as well as those of Italy and the
                provinces of Gaul and Spain.
                <br>
                At last, when all were thunder-struck at his actions and wondered what their purpose could be, the
                consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus, after first making proclamation that he
                purposed to bring before the senate a matter of the highest public moment, proposed that a successor to
                Caesar be appointed before the end of his term, on the ground that the war was ended, peace was
                established, and the victorious army ought to be disbanded; also that no account be taken of Caesar at
                the elections, unless he were present, since Pompey's subsequent action had not annulled the decree of
                the people. And it was true that when Pompey proposed a bill touching the privileges of officials, in
                the clause whereby he debarred absentees from candidacy for office he forgot to make a special exception
                in Caesar's case, and did not correct the oversight until the law had been inscribed on a tablet of
                bronze and deposited in the treasury. Not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces and his
                privilege, Marcellus also moved that the colonists whom Caesar had settled in Novum Comum by the bill of
                Vatinius should lose their citizenship, on the ground that it had been given from political motives and
                was not authorized by the law.

            <p>
                Greatly troubled by these measures, and thinking, as they say he was often heard to remark, that now
                that he was the leading man of the state, it was harder to push him down from the first place to the
                second than it would be from the second to the lowest, Caesar stoutly resisted Marcellus, partly through
                vetoes of the tribunes and partly through the other consul, Servius Sulpicius. When next year Gaius
                Marcellus, who had succeeded his cousin Marcus as consul, tried the same thing, Caesar by a heavy bribe
                secured the support of the other consul, Aemilius Paulus, and of Gaius Curio, the most reckless of the
                tribunes. But seeing that everything was being pushed most persistently, and that even the consuls
                elect were among the opposition, he sent a written appeal to the senate, not to take from him the
                privilege which the people had granted, or else to compel the others in command of armies to resign
                also; feeling sure, it was thought, that he could more readily muster his veterans as soon as he wished,
                than Pompey his newly levied troops. He further proposed a compromise to his opponents, that after
                giving up eight legions and Transalpine Gaul, he be allowed to keep two legions and Cisalpine Gaul, or
                at least one legion and Illyricum, until he was elected consul.

                But when the senate declined to interfere, and his opponents declared that they would accept no
                compromise in a matter affecting the public welfare, he crossed to Hither Gaul, and after holding all
                the assizes, halted at Ravenna, intending to resort to war if the senate took any drastic action against
                the tribunes of the commons who interposed vetoes in his behalf. Now this was his excuse  for the
                civil war, but it is believed that he had other motives. Gnaeus Pompeius used to declare that since
                Caesar's own means were not sufficient to complete the works which he had planned, nor to do all that he
                had led the people to expect on his return, he desired a state of general unrest and turmoil. Others
                say that he dreaded the necessity of rendering an account for what he had done in his first consulship
                contrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of vetoes; for Marcus Cato often declared, and
                took oath too, that he would impeach Caesar the moment he had disbanded his army. It was openly said too
                that if he was out of office on his return, he would be obliged, like Milo, to make his defence in a
                court hedged about by armed men. The latter opinion is the more credible one in view of the assertion
                of Asinius Pollio, that when Caesar at the battle of Pharsalus saw his enemies slain or in flight, he
                said, word for word: 
                <br>
                "They would have it so. Even I, Gaius Caesar, after so many great deeds, should
                have been found guilty, if I had not turned to my army for help."
                <br>
                Some think that habit had given him a love of power, and that weighing the strength of his adversaries against his own, he grasped the
                opportunity of usurping the despotism which had been his heart's desire from early youth. Cicero too was
                seemingly of this opinion, when he wrote in the third book of his De Officiis that Caesar ever had
                upon his lips these lines of Euripides, of which Cicero himself adds a version:
                <br>
                "If wrong may e'er be right, for a throne's sake
                Were wrong most right:— be God in all else feared."
