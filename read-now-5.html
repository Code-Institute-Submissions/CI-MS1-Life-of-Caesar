                He rode a remarkable horse, too, with feet that were almost human; for its hoofs were cloven in such a
                way as to look like toes. This horse was foaled on his own place, and since the soothsayers had declared
                that it foretold the rule of the world for its master, he reared it with the greatest care, and was the
                first to mount it, for it would endure no other rider. Afterwards, too, he dedicated a statue of it
                before the temple of Venus Genetrix.

                When his army gave way, he often rallied it single-handed, planting himself in the way of the fleeing
                men, laying hold of them one by one, and even catching them by the throat and forcing them to face the
                enemy; that, too, when they were in such a panic that an eagle-bearer made a pass at him with the
                point as he tried to stop him, while another left the standard in Caesar's hand when he would hold him
                back.

                His presence of mind was no less renowned, and the instances of it will appear even more striking. After
                the battle of Pharsalus, when he had sent on his troops and was crossing the strait of the Hellespont in
                a small passenger boat, he met Lucius Cassius, of the hostile party, with ten armoured ships,58 and made
                no attempt to escape, but went to meet Cassius and actually urged him to surrender; and Cassius sued for
                mercy and was taken on board.

                At Alexandria, while assaulting a bridge, he was forced by a sudden sally of the enemy to take to a
                small skiff; when many others threw themselves into the same boat, he plunged into the sea, and after
                swimming for two hundred paces, got away to the nearest ship, holding up his left hand all the way, so
                as not to wet some papers which he was carrying, and dragging his cloak after him with his teeth, to
                keep the enemy from getting it as a trophy.

                He valued his soldiers neither for their personal character nor for their fortune, but solely for their
                prowess, and he treated them with equal strictness and indulgence; for he did not curb them everywhere
                and at all times, but only in the presence of the enemy. Then he required the strictest discipline,
                not announcing the time of a march or a battle, but keeping them ready and alert to be led on a sudden
                at any moment wheresoever he might wish. He often called them out even when there was no occasion for
                it, especially on rainy days and holidays. And warning them every now and then that they must keep close
                watch on him, he would steal away suddenly by day or night and make a longer march than usual, to tire
                out those who were tardy in following.

        <h1>Ch LXVI:</h1>
        <p>
            When they were in a panic through reports about the enemy's numbers, he used to rouse their courage not by
            denying or discounting the rumours, but by falsely exaggerating the true danger. For instance, when the
            anticipation of Juba's coming filled them with terror, he called the soldiers together and said:
            <br>
            "Let me tell you that within the next few days the king will be here with ten legions, thirty thousand
            horsemen, a
            hundred thousand light-armed troops, and three hundred elephants. Therefore some of you may as well cease to
            ask further questions or make surmises and may rather believe me, since I know all about it. Otherwise, I
            shall surely have them shipped on some worn out craft and carried off to whatever lands the wind may blow
            them."
        </p>

    <div class="chapter" id="ch-67">

        <h1>Ch LXVII:</h1>
        <p>
            He did not take notice of all their offences or punish them by rule, but he kept a sharp look out for
            deserters and mutineers, and chastised them most severely, shutting his eyes to other faults. Sometimes,
            too, after a great victory he relieved of all duties and gave them full licence to revel, being in the habit
            of boasting that his soldiers could fight well even when reeking of perfumes. In the assembly he
            addressed them not as "soldiers," but by the more flattering term "comrades," and he kept them in fine trim,
            furnishing them with arms inlaid with silver and gold, both for show and to make them hold the faster to
            them in battle, through fear of the greatness of the loss. Such was his love for them that when he heard of
            the disaster to Titurius, he let his hair and beard grow long, and would not cut them until he had taken
            vengeance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-68">

        <h1>Ch LXVIII:</h1>
        <p>
            In this way he made them most devoted to his interests as well as most valiant. When he began the civil war,
            every centurion of each legion proposed to supply a horseman from his own savings, and the soldiers one and
            all offered their service without pay and without rations, the richer assuming the care of the poorer.
            Throughout the long struggle not one deserted and many of them, on being taken prisoner, refused to accept
            their lives, when offered them on the condition of consenting to serve against Caesar. They bore hunger
            and other hardships, both when in a state of siege and when besieging others, with such fortitude, that when
            Pompey saw in the works at Dyrrachium a kind of bread made of herbs, on which they were living, he said that
            he was fighting wild beasts; and he gave orders that it be put out of sight quickly and shown to none of his
            men, for fear that the endurance and resolution of the foe would break their spirit.
            <br>
            <br>
            How valiantly they fought is shown by the fact that when they suffered their sole defeat before Dyrrachium,
            they insisted on being punished, and their commander felt called upon rather to console them than to
            chastise them. In the other battles they overcame with ease countless forces of the enemy, though
            decidedly fewer in number themselves. Indeed one cohort of the sixth legion, when set to defend a redoubt,
            kept four legions of Pompey at bay for several hours, though almost all were wounded by the enemy's showers
            of arrows, of which a hundred and thirty thousand were picked up within the ramparts. And no wonder, when
            one thinks of the deeds of individual soldiers, either of Cassius Scaeva the centurion, or of Gaius Acilius
            of the rank and file, not to mention others. Scaeva, with one eye gone, his thigh and shoulder wounded, and
            his shield bored through in a hundred and twenty places, continued to guard the gate of a fortress put in
            his charge. Acilius in the sea-fight at Massilia grasped the stern of one of the enemy's ships, and when his
            right hand was lopped off, rivalling the famous exploit of the Greek hero Cynegirus, boarded the ship and
            drove the enemy before him with the boss of his shield.

            They did not mutiny once during the ten years of the Gallic war; in the civil wars they did so now and then,
            but quickly resumed their duty, not so much owing to any indulgence of their general as to his authority.
            For he never gave way to them when they were insubordinate, but always boldly faced them, discharging the
            entire ninth legion in disgrace before Placentia, though Pompey was still in the field, reinstating them
            unwillingly and only after many abject entreaties, and insisting on punishing the ringleaders.

            Again at Rome, when the men of the Tenth clamoured for their discharge and rewards with terrible threats and
            no little peril to the city, though the war in Africa was then raging, he did not hesitate to appear
            before them, against the advice of his friends, and to disband them. But with a single word, calling them
            "citizens," instead of "soldiers," he easily brought them round and bent them to his will; for they at once
            replied that they were his "soldiers" and insisted on following him to Africa, although he refused their
            service. Even then he punished the most insubordinate by the loss of a third part of the booty and of the
            land intended for them.

            1 Even when a young man he showed no lack of devotion and fidelity to his dependents. He defended Masintha,
            a youth of high birth, against king Hiempsal with such spirit, that in the dispute he caught the king's son
            Juba by the beard. On Masintha's being declared tributary to the king, he at once rescued him from those who
            would carry him off and kept him hidden for some time in his own house; and when presently he left for Spain
            after his praetorship, he carried the young man off in his own litter, unnoticed amid the crowd that came to
            see him off and the lictors with their fasces.

        <h1>Ch LXXII:</h1>

            His friends he treated with invariable kindness and consideration. When Gaius Oppius was his companion on a
            journey through a wild, woody country and was suddenly taken ill, Caesar gave up to him the only shelter59
            there was, while he himself slept on the ground out-of doors. Moreover, when he came to power, he advanced
            some of his friends to the highest positions, even though they were of the humblest origin, and when taken
            to task for it, flatly declared that if he had been helped in defending his honour by brigands and
            cut-throats, he would have requited even such men in the same way.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-73">

        <h1>Ch LXXIII:</h1>
        <p>
            On the other hand he never formed such bitter enmities that he was not glad to lay them aside when
            opportunity offered. Although Gaius Memmius had made highly caustic speeches against him, to which he had
            replied with equal bitterness, he went so far as to support Memmius afterwards in his suit for the
            consulship. When Gaius Calvus, after some scurrilous epigrams, took steps through his friends towards a
            reconciliation, Caesar wrote to him first and of his own free will. Valerius Catullus, as Caesar himself did
            not hesitate to say, inflicted a lasting stain on his name by the verses about Mamurra; yet when he
            apologised, Caesar invited the poet to dinner that very same day, and continued his usual friendly relations
            with Catullus's father.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chapter" id="ch-74">

        <h1>Ch LXXIV:</h1>
        <p>Even in avenging wrongs he was by nature most merciful, and when he got hold of the pirates who had captured
            him, he had them crucified, since he had sworn beforehand that he would do so, but ordered that their
            throats be cut first. He could never make up his mind to harm Cornelius Phagites, although when he was sick
            and in hiding, the man had waylaid him night after night, and even a bribe had barely saved him from being
            handed over to Sulla. The slave Philemon, his amanuensis, who had promised Caesar's enemies that he would
            poison him, he merely punished by death, without torture. When summoned as a witness against Publius
            Clodius, the paramour of his wife Pompeia, charged on the same count with sacrilege, Caesar declared that he
            had no evidence, although both his mother Aurelia and his sister Julia had given the same jurors a faithful
            account of the whole affair; and on being asked why it was then that he had put away his wife, he
            replied: "Because I maintain that the members of my family should be free from suspicion, as well as from
            accusation."
        </p>

    <div class="chapter" id="ch-75">

        <h1>Ch LXXV:</h1>
        <p>
            He certainly showed admirable self-restraint and mercy, both in his conduct of the civil war and in the hour
            of victory. While Pompey announced that he would treat as enemies those who did not take up arms for the
            government, Caesar gave out that those who were neutral and of neither party would be numbered with his
            friends. He freely allowed all those whom he had made centurions on Pompey's recommendation to go over to
            his rival. When conditions of surrender were under discussion at Ilerda, and friendly intercourse between
            the two parties was constant, Afranius and Petreius, with a sudden change of purpose, put to death all of
            Caesar's soldiers whom they found in their camp; but Caesar could not bring himself to retaliate in kind. At
            the battle of Pharsalus he cried out, "Spare your fellow citizens," and afterwards allowed each of his men
            to save any one man he pleased of the opposite party.
            <br>
            And it will be found that no Pompeian lost his life except in battle, save only Afranius and Faustus, and the young Lucius Caesar; and it is believed that not
            even these men were slain by his wish, even though the two former had taken up arms again after being
            pardoned, while Caesar had not only cruelly put to death the dictator's slaves and freedmen with fire and
            sword, but had even butchered the wild beasts which he had procured for the entertainment of the people. 4
            At last, in his later years, he went so far as to allow all those whom he had not yet pardoned to return to
            Italy, and to hold magistracies and the command of armies: and he actually set up the statues of Lucius
            Sulla and Pompey, which had been broken to pieces by the populace. After this, if any dangerous plots were
            formed against him, or slanders uttered, he preferred to quash rather than to punish them.
            <br>
            Accordingly, he took no further notice of the conspiracies which were detected, and of meetings by night, than to make known
            by proclamation that he was aware of them; and he thought it enough to give public warning to those who
            spoke ill of him, not to persist in their conduct, bearing with good nature the attacks on his reputation
            made by the scurrilous volume of Aulus Caecina and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaus.
