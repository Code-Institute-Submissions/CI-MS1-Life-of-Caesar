                He lived at first in the Subura in a modest house, but after he became pontifex maximus, in the
                official residence on the Sacred Way. Many have written that he was very fond of elegance and luxury;
                that having laid the foundations of a country-house on his estate at Nemi and finished it at great cost,
                he tore it all down because it did not suit him in every particular, although at the time he was still
                poor and heavily in debt; and that he carried tesselated and mosaic floorsd about with him on his
                campaigns.

                They say that he was led to invade Britain by the hope of getting pearls, and that in comparing their
                size he sometimes weighed them with his own hand; that he was always a most enthusiastic collector of
                gems, carvings, statues, and pictures by early artists; also of slaves of exceptional figure and
                training at enormous prices, of which he himself was so ashamed that he forbade their entry in his

                It is further reported that in the provinces he gave banquets constantly in two dining-halls, in one of
                which his officers or Greek companions, in the other Roman civilians and the more distinguished of the
                provincials reclined at table. He was so punctilious and strict in the management of his household, in
                small matters as well as in those of greater importance, that he put his baker in irons for serving him
                with one kind of bread and his guests with another; and he inflicted capital punishment on a favourite
                freedman for adultery with the wife of a Roman knight, although no complaint was made against him.

            <h1>Ch XLIX:</h1>
            <p>
                There was no stain on his reputation for chastity except his intimacy with King Nicomedes, but that
                was a deep and lasting reproach, which laid him open to insults from every quarter. I say nothing of the
                notorious lines of Licinius Calvus:
                <br>
                <br>
                "Whate'er Bithynia had, and Caesar's paramour."
                <br>
                <br>
                I pass over, too, the invectives of Dolabella and the elder Curio, in which Dolabella calls him "the
                queen's rival, the inner partner of the royal couch," and Curio, "the brothel of Nicomedes and the stew
                of Bithynia." I take no account of the edicts of Bibulus, in which he posted his colleague as "the
                queen of Bithynia," saying that "of yore he was enamoured of a king, but now of a king's estate." At
                this same time, so Marcus Brutus declares, one Octavius, a man whose disordered mind made him somewhat
                free with his tongue, after saluting Pompey as "king" in a crowded assembly, greeted Caesar as "queen."
                But Gaius Memmius makes the direct charge that he acted as cup-bearer to Nicomedes with the rest of his
                wantons at a large dinner-party, and that among the guests were some merchants from Rome, whose names
                Memmius gives.
                <br>
                Cicero, indeed, is not content with having written in sundry letters that Caesar was
                led by the king's attendants to the royal apartments, that he lay on a golden couch arrayed in purple,
                and that the virginity of this son of Venus was lost in Bithynia; but when Caesar was once addressing
                the senate in defence of Nysa, daughter of Nicomedes, and was enumerating his obligations to the king,
                Cicero cried: "No more of that, pray, for it is well known what he gave you, and what you gave him in
                turn."
                <br>
                Finally, in his Gallic triumph his soldiers, among the bantering songs which are usually
                sung by those who followed the chariot, shouted these lines, which became a by-word:
                <br>
                <br>
                "All the Gauls did Caesar vanquish, Nicomedes vanquished him;
                Lo! now Caesar rides in triumph, victor over all the Gauls,
                Nicomedes does not triumph, who subdued the conqueror."

            <p>
                That he was unbridled and extravagant in his intrigues is the general opinion, and that he seduced many
                illustrious women, among them Postumia, wife of Servius Sulpicius, Lollia, wife of Aulus Gabinius,
                Tertulla, wife of Marcus Crassus, and even Gnaeus Pompey's wife Mucia. At all events there is no doubt
                that Pompey was taken to task by the elder and the younger Curio, as well as by many others, because
                through a desire for power he had afterwards married the daughter of a man on whose account he divorced
                a wife who had borne him three children, and whom he had often referred to with a groan as an
                Aegisthus.
                <br>
                But beyond all others Caesar loved Servilia, the mother of Marcus Brutus, for whom in his
                first consulship he bought a pearl costing six million sesterces. During the civil war, too, besides
                other presents, he knocked down some fine estates to her in a public auction at a nominal price, and
                when some expressed their surprise at the low figure, Cicero wittily remarked:
                <br>
                "It's a better bargain than you think, for there is a third off."
                <br>
                And in fact it was thought that Servilia was prostituting
                her own daughter Tertia to Caesar.

        <p>
            That he did not refrain from intrigues in the provinces is shown in particular by this couplet, which was
            also shouted by the soldiers in his Gallic triumph:
            <br>
            "Men of Rome, keep close to your consorts, here's a bald adulterer.
            Gold in Gaul you spent in dalliance, which you borrowed here in Rome."
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-52">

        <h1>Ch LII:</h1>
        <p>
            He had love affairs with queens too, including Eunoe the Moor, wife of Bogudes, on whom, as well as on her
            husband, he bestowed many splendid presents, as Naso writes; but above all with Cleopatra, with whom he
            often feasted until daybreak, and he would have gone through Egypt with her in her state-barge almost to
            Aethiopia, had not his soldiers refused to follow him.
            <br>
            Finally he called her to Rome and did not let her leave until he had ladened her with high honours and rich
            gifts, and he allowed her to give his name to the
            child which she bore. In fact, according to certain Greek writers, this child was very like Caesar in
            looks and carriage. Mark Antony declared to the senate that Caesar had really acknowledged the boy, and that
            Gaius Matius, Gaius Oppius, and other friends of Caesar knew this. Of these Gaius Oppius, as if admitting
            that the situation required apology and defence, published a book, to prove that the child whom Cleopatra
            fathered on Caesar was not his. Helvius Cinna, tribune of the commons, admitted to several that he had a
            bill drawn up in due form, which Caesar had ordered him to propose to the people in his absence, making it
            lawful for Caesar to marry what wives he wished, and as many as he wished, "for the purpose of begetting
            children." But to remove all doubt that he had an evil reputation both for shameless vice and for
            adultery, I have only to add that the elder Curio in one of his speeches calls him "every woman's man and
            every man's woman."

        <h1>Ch LIII:</h1>
        <p>
            That he drank very little wine not even his enemies denied. There is a saying of Marcus Cato that Caesar was
            the only man who undertook to overthrow the state when sober. Even in the matter of food Gaius Oppius tells
            us that he was so indifferent, that once when his host served stale oil instead of fresh, and the other
            guests would have none of it, Caesar partook even more plentifully than usual, not to seem to charge his
            host with carelessness or lack of manners.

        <h1>Ch LIV:</h1>
        <p>
            Neither when in command of armies nor as a magistrate at Rome did he show a scrupulous integrity; for as
            certain men have declared in their memoirs, when he was proconsul in Spain, he not only begged money from
            the allies, to help pay his debts, but also attacked and sacked some towns of the Lusitanians although they
            did not refuse his terms and opened their gates to him on his arrival. In Gaul he pillaged shrines and
            temples of the gods filled with offerings, and oftener sacked towns for the sake of plunder than for any
            fault. In consequence he had more gold than he knew what to do with, and offered it for sale throughout
            Italy and the provinces at the rate of three thousand sesterces the pound. In his first consulship he
            stole three thousand pounds of gold from the Capitol, replacing it with the same weight of gilded bronze. He
            made alliances and thrones a matter of barter, for he extorted from Ptolemy alone in his own name and
            that of Pompey nearly six thousand talents, while later on he met the heavy expenses of the civil wars and
            of his triumphs and entertainments by the most bare-faced pillage and sacrilege.

    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-55">

        <h1>Ch LV:</h1>
        <p>
            In eloquence and in the art of war he either equalled or surpassed the fame of their most eminent
            representatives. After his accusation of Dolabella, he was without question numbered with the leading
            advocates. At all events when Cicero reviews the orators in his Brutus, he says that he does not see to
            whom Caesar ought to yield the palm, declaring that his style is elegant as well as transparent, even grand
            and in a sense noble. Again in a letter to Cornelius Nepos he writes thus of Caesar:
            <br>
            "Come now, what orator would you rank above him of those who have devoted themselves to nothing else? Who
            has cleverer or
            more frequent epigrams? Who is either more picturesque or more choice in diction?"
            <br>
            He appears, at least in his youth, to have imitated the manner of Caesar Strabo, from whose speech entitled
            "For the Sardinians" he
            actually transferred some passages word for word to a trial address of his own. He is said to have
            delivered himself in a high-pitched voice with impassioned action and gestures, which were not without
            grace. He left several speeches, including some which are attributed to him on insufficient evidence.
            Augustus had good reason to think that the speech "For Quintus Metellus" was rather taken down by shorthand
            writers who could not keep pace with his delivery, than published by Caesar himself; for in some copies I
            find that even the title is not "For Metellus," but, "Which he wrote for Metellus," although the discourse
            purports to be from Caesar's lips, defending Metellus and himself against the charges of their common
            detractors. Augustus also questions the authenticity of the "To His Soldiers in Spain," although
            there are two sections of it, one purporting to have been spoken at the first battle, the other at the
            second, when Asinius Pollio writes that because of the sudden onslaught of the enemy he actually did not
            have time to make an harangue.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-56">

        <h1>Ch LVI:</h1>
        <p>
            He left memoirs too of his deeds in the Gallic war and in the civil strife with Pompey; for the author of
            the Alexandrian, African, and Spanish Wars is unknown; some think it was Oppius, others Hirtius, who also
            supplied the final book of the Gallic War, which Caesar left unwritten. With regard to Caesar's memoirs
            Cicero, also in the Brutus speaks in the following terms:
            <br>"He wrote memoirs which deserve the highest praise; they are naked in their simplicity, straightforward
            yet graceful, stripped of all rhetorical
            adornment, as of a garment; but while his purpose was to supply material to others, on which those who
            wished to write history might draw, he haply gratified silly folk, who will try to use the curling-irons on
            his narrative, but he has kept men of any sense from touching the subject."
            <br>
            Of these same memoirs Hirtius uses this emphatic language:
            <br>
            "They are so highly rated in the judgment of all men, that he seems to have
            deprived writers of an opportunity, rather than given them one; yet our admiration for this feat is greater
            than that of others; for they know how well and faultlessly he wrote, while we know besides how easily and
            rapidly he finished his task."
            <br>
            Asinius Pollio thinks that they were put together somewhat carelessly and
            without strict regard for truth; since in many cases Caesar was too ready to believe the accounts which
            others gave of their actions, and gave a perverted account of his own, either designedly or perhaps from
            forgetfulness; and he thinks that he intended to rewrite and revise them. He left besides a work in two
            volumes "On Analogy," the same number of "Speeches criticising Cato," in addition to a poem, entitled "The
            Journey." He wrote the first of these works while crossing the Alps and returning to his army from Hither
            Gaul, where he had held the assizes; the second about the time of the battle of Munda, and the third in the
            course of a twenty-four days' journey from Rome to Farther Spain. Some letters of his to the senate are
            also preserved, and he seems to have been the first to reduce such documents to pages and the form of a
            note-book, whereas previously consuls and generals sent their reports written right across the sheet.
            <br>
            There are also letters of his to Cicero, as well as to his intimates on private affairs, and in the latter,
            if he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the
            letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at
            their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the
            others. We also have mention of certain writings of his boyhood and early youth, such as the "Praises of
            Hercules," a tragedy "Oedipus," and a "Collection of Apophthegms"; but Augustus forbade the publication of
            all these minor works in a very brief and frank letter sent to Pompeius Macer, whom he had selected to set
            his libraries in order.

            He was highly skilled in arms and horsemanship, and of incredible powers of endurance. On the march he
            headed his army, sometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, bareheaded both in the heat of the sun and in
            rain. He covered great distances with incredible speed, making a hundred miles a day in a hired carriage and
            with little baggage, swimming the rivers which barred his path or crossing them on inflated skins, and very
            often arriving before the messengers sent to announce his coming.

            In the conduct of his campaigns it is a question whether he was more cautious or more daring, for he never
            led his army where ambuscades were possible without carefully reconnoitring the country, and he did not
            cross to Britain without making personal inquiries about the harbours, the course, and the approach to the
            island. But on the other hand, when news came that his camp in Germany was beleaguered, he made his way to
            his men through the enemies' pickets, disguised as a Gaul. He crossed from Brundisium to Dyrrachium in
            winter time, running the blockade of the enemy's fleets; and when the troops which he had ordered to follow
            him delayed to do so, and he had sent to fetch them many times in vain, at last in secret and alone he
            boarded a small boat at night with his head muffled up; and he did not reveal who he was, or suffer the
            helmsman to give way to the gale blowing in their teeth, until he was all but overwhelmed by the waves.

            No regard for religion ever turned him from any undertaking, or even delayed him. Though the victim escaped
            as he was offering sacrifice, he did not put off his expedition against Scipio and Juba. Even when he
            had a fall as he disembarked, he gave the omen a favourable turn by crying: "I hold thee fast, Africa."
            Furthermore, to make the prophecies ridiculous which declared that the stock of the Scipios was fated to be
            fortunate and invincible in that province, he kept with him in camp a contemptible fellow belonging to the
            Cornelian family, to whom the nickname Salvito had been given as a reproach for his manner of life.

            He joined battle, not only after planning his movements in advance but on a sudden opportunity, often
            immediately at the end of a march, and sometimes in the foulest weather, when one would least expect him to
            make a move. It was not until his later years that he became slower to engage, through a conviction that the
            oftener he had been victor, the less he ought to tempt fate, and that he could not possibly gain as much by
            success as he might lose by defeat. He never put his enemy to flight without also driving him from his camp,
            thus giving him no respite in his panic. When the issue was doubtful, he used to send away the horses, and
            his own among the first, to impose upon the troops the greater necessity of standing their ground by taking
            away that aid to flight.
