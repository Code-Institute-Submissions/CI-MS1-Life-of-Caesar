            <p>
                Accordingly, when word came that the veto of the tribunes had been set aside and they themselves had
                left the city, he at once sent on a few cohorts with all secrecy, and then, to disarm suspicion,
                concealed his purpose by appearing at a public show inspecting the plans of a gladiatorial school which
                he intended building, and joining as usual in a banquet with a large company. It was not until after
                sunset that he set out very privily with a small company, taking the mules from a bakeshop hard by and
                harnessing them to a carriage; and when his lights went out and he lost his way, he was astray for some
                time, but at last found a guide at dawn and got back to the road on foot by narrow by-paths. Then,
                overtaking his cohorts at the river Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, he paused for a
                while, and realising what a step he was taking, he turned to those about him and said: "Even yet we may
                draw back; but once cross yon little bridge, and the whole issue is with the sword."

                As he stood in doubt, this sign was given him. On a sudden there appeared hard by a being of wondrous
                stature and beauty, who sat and played upon a reed; and when not only the shepherds flocked to hear him,
                but many of the soldiers left their posts, and among them some of the trumpeters, the apparition
                snatched a trumpet from one of them, rushed to the river, and sounding the war-note with mighty blast,
                strode to the opposite bank.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then Caesar cried: "Take we the course which the signs of the gods and the
                false dealing of our foes point out. The die is cast," said he.

            <p>
                Accordingly, crossing with his army, and welcoming the tribunes of the commons, who had come to him
                after being driven from Rome, he harangued the soldiers with tears, and rending his robe from his breast
                besought their faithful service. It is even thought that he promised every man a knight's estate, but
                that came of a misunderstanding: for since he often pointed to the finger of his left hand as he
                addressed them and urged them on, declaring that to satisfy all those who helped him to defend his
                honour he would gladly tear this very ring from his hand, those on the edge of the assembly, who could
                see him better than they could hear his words, assumed that he said what his gesture seemed to mean; and
                so the report went about that he had promised them the right of the ring and four hundred thousand
                sesterces as well.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter" id="ch-34">

            <h1>Ch XXXIV:</h1>
            <p>
                The sum total of his movements after that is, in their order, as follows: He overran Umbria, Picenum,
                and Etruria, took prisoner Lucius Domitius, who had been irregularly named his successor, and was
                holding Corfinium with a garrison, let him go free, and then proceeded along the Adriatic to Brundisium,
                where Pompey and the consuls had taken refuge, intending to cross the sea as soon as might be. After
                trying by every kind of hindrance to prevent their sailing, he marched off to Rome, and after calling
                the senate together to discuss public business, went to attack Pompey's strongest forces, which were in
                Spain under command of three of his lieutenants — Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, and Marcus Varro —
                saying to his friends before he left "I go to meet an army without a leader, and I shall return to meet
                a leader without an army." And in fact, though his advance was delayed by the siege of Massilia, which
                had shut its gates against him, and by extreme scarcity of supplies, he nevertheless quickly gained
                a complete victory.
            </p>

        <div class="chapter" id="ch-35">

            <h1>Ch XXXV:</h1>
            <p>
                Returning thence to Rome, he crossed into Macedonia, and after blockading Pompey for almost four months
                behind mighty ramparts, finally routed him in the battle at Pharsalus, followed him in his flight to
                Alexandria, and when he learned that his rival had been slain, made war on King Ptolemy, whom he
                perceived to be plotting against his own safety as well; a war in truth of great difficulty, convenient
                neither in time nor place, but carried on during the winter season, within the walls of a
                well-provisioned and crafty foeman, while Caesar himself was without supplies of any kind and
                ill-prepared.
                <br>
                <br>
                Victor in spite of all, he turned over the rule of Egypt to Cleopatra and her younger
                brother, fearing that if he made a province of it, it might one day under a headstrong governor be a
                source of revolution.
                <br>
                <br> From Alexandria he crossed to Syria, and from there went to Pontus, spurred on
                by the news that Pharnaces, son of Mithridates the Great, had taken advantage of the situation to make
                war, and was already flushed with numerous successes; but Caesar vanquished him in a single battle
                within five days after his arrival and four hours after getting sight of him, often remarking on
                Pompey's good luck in gaining his principal fame as a general by victories over such feeble foemen. Then
                he overcame Scipio and Juba, who were patching up the remnants of their party in Africa, and the sons of
                Pompey in Spain.

        <h1>Ch XXXVI:</h1>
        <p>
            In all the civil wars he suffered not a single disaster except through his lieutenants, of p51 whom Gaius
            Curio perished in Africa, Gaius Antonius fell into the hands of the enemy in Illyricum, Publius Dolabella
            lost a fleet also off Illyricum, and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus an army in Pontus. Personally he always fought
            with the utmost success, and the issue was never even in doubt save twice: once at Dyrrachium, where he was
            put to flight, and said of Pompey, who failed to follow up his success, that he did not know how to use a
            victory; again in Spain, in the final struggle, when, believing the battle lost, he actually thought of
            suicide.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-37">

        <h1>Ch XXXVII:</h1>
        <p>
            Having ended the wars, he celebrated five triumphs, four in a single month, but at intervals of a few
            days, after vanquishing Scipio; and another on defeating Pompey's sons. The first and most splendid was the
            Gallic triumph, the next the Alexandrian, then the Pontic, after that the African, and finally the Spanish,
            each differing from the rest in its equipment and display of spoils.
            <br>
            As he rode through the Velabrum on the day of his Gallic triumph, the axle of his chariot broke, and he was
            all but thrown out; and he mounted
            the Capitol by torchlight, with forty elephants bearing lamps on his right and his left. In his Pontic
            triumph he displayed among the show-pieces of the procession an inscription of but three words, "I came, I
            saw, I conquered," not indicating the events of the war, as the others did, but the speed with which it was
            finished.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-38">

        <h1>Ch XXXVIII:</h1>
        <p>
            To each and every foot-soldier of his veteran legions he gave twenty-four thousand sesterces by way of
            booty, over and above the two thousand apiece which he had paid them at the beginning of the civil strife.
            He also assigned them lands, but not side by side, to avoid dispossessing any of the former owners. To
            every man of the people, besides ten pecks of grain and the same number of pounds of oil, he distributed
            the three hundred sesterces which he had promised at first, and one hundred apiece to boot because of the
            delay. He also remitted a year's rent in Rome to tenants who paid two thousand sesterces or less, and in
            Italy up to five hundred sesterces. He added a banquet and a dole of meat, and after his Spanish victory two
            dinners; for deeming that the former of these had not been served with a liberality creditable to his
            generosity, he gave another five days later on a most lavish scale.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chapter" id="ch-39">

        <h1>Ch XXXIX:</h1>
        <p>
            He gave entertainments of divers kinds: a combat of gladiators and also stage-plays in every ward all over
            the city, performed too by actors of all languages, as well as races in the circus, athletic contests, and a
            sham sea-fight. In the gladiatorial contest in the Forum Furius Leptinus, a man of praetorian stock, and
            Quintus Calpenus, a former senator and pleader at the bar, fought to a finish. A Pyrrhic dance was performed
            by the sons of the princes of Asia and Bithynia. During the plays Decimus Laberius, a Roman knight, acted
            a farce of his own composition, and having been presented with five hundred thousand sesterces and a gold
            ring, passed from the stage through the orchestra and took his place in the fourteen rows.
            <br>
            For the races the circus was lengthened at either end and a broad canal was dug all about it; then young men
            of the
            highest rank drove four-horse and two-horse chariots and rode pairs of horses, vaulting from one to the
            other. The game called Troy was performed by two troops, of younger and of older boys. Combats with
            wild beasts were presented on five successive days, and last of all there was a battle between two opposing
            armies, in which five hundred foot-soldiers, twenty elephants, and thirty horsemen engaged on each side. To
            make room for this, the goals were taken down and in their place two camps were pitched over against each
            other. The athletic competitions lasted for three days in a temporary stadium built for the purpose in the
            region of the Campus Martius. 4 For the naval battle a pool was dug in the lesser Codeta and there was a
            contest of ships of two, three, and four banks of oars, belonging to the Tyrian and Egyptian fleets, manned
            by a large force of fighting men. Such a throng flocked to all these shows from every quarter, that many
            strangers had to lodge in tents pitched in streets or along the roads, and the press was often such that
            many were crushed to death, including two senators.

        <h1>Ch XL:</h1>
        <p>
            Then turning his attention to the reorganisation of the state, he reformed the calendar, which the
            negligence of the pontiffs had long since so disordered, through their privilege of adding months or days at
            pleasure, that the harvest festivals did not come in summer nor those of the vintage in the autumn; and he
            adjusted the year to the sun's course by making it consist of three hundred and sixty-five days, abolishing
            the intercalary month, and adding one day every fourth year. Furthermore, that the correct reckoning of
            seasons might begin with the next Kalends of January, he inserted two other months between those of November
            and December; hence the year in which these arrangements were made was one of fifteen months, including
            the intercalary month, which belonged to that year according to the former custom.

    <div class="chapter" id="ch-41">

        <h1>Ch XLI:</h1>
        <p>
            He filled the vacancies in the senate, enrolled additional patricians, and increased the number of
            praetors, aediles, and quaestors, as well as of the minor officials; he reinstated those who had been
            degraded by official action of the censors or found guilty of bribery by verdict of the jurors. He shared
            the elections with the people on this basis: that except in the case of the consulship, half of the
            magistrates should be appointed by the people's choice, while the rest should be those whom he had
            personally nominated. And these he announced in brief notes like the following, circulated in each tribe:
            "Caesar the Dictator to this or that tribe. I commend to you so and so, to hold their positions by your
            votes." He admitted to office even the sons of those who had been proscribed. He limited the right of
            serving as jurors to two classes, the equestrian and senatorial orders, disqualifying the third class, the
            tribunes of the treasury.
            <br>
            He made the enumeration of the people neither in the usual manner nor place, but from street to street
            aided by the owners of blocks of houses, and reduced the number of those who received grain at public
            expense from three hundred and twenty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand. And to prevent the calling
            of additional meetings at any future time for purposes of enrolment, he provided that the places of such as
            died should be filled each year by the praetors from those who were not on the list.

    <div class="chapter" id="ch-42">

        <h1>Ch XLII:</h1>
        <p>
            Moreover, to keep up the population of the city, depleted as it was by the assignment of eighty thousand
            citizens to colonies across the sea, he made a law that no citizen older than twenty or younger than forty,
            who was not detained by service in the army, should be absent from Italy for more than three successive
            years; that no senator's son should go abroad except as the companion of a magistrate or on his staff; and
            that those who made a business of grazing should have among their herdsmen at least one-third who were men
            of free birth. He conferred citizenship on all who practised medicine at Rome, and on all teachers of the
            liberal arts, to make them more desirous of living in the city and to induce others to resort to it.
            <br>
            As to debts, he disappointed those who looked for their cancellation, which was often agitated, but
            finally decreed that the debtors should satisfy their creditors according to a valuation of their
            possessions at the price what they had paid for them before the civil war, deducting from the principal
            whatever interest had been paid in cash or pledged through bankers; an arrangement which wiped out about a
            fourth part of their indebtedness. He dissolved all guilds, except those of ancient foundation. He
            increased the penalties for crimes; and inasmuch as the rich involved themselves in guilt with less
            hesitation because they merely suffered exile, without any loss of property, he punished murderers of
            freemen41 by the confiscation of all their goods, as Cicero writes, and others by the loss of one-half.

            He administered justice with the utmost conscientiousness and strictness. Those convicted of extortion he
            even dismissed from the senatorial order. He annulled the marriage of an ex-praetor, who had married a woman
            the very day after her divorce, although there was no suspicion of adultery. He imposed duties on
            foreign wares. He denied the use of litters and the wearing of scarlet robes or pearls to all except those
            of a designated position and age, and on set days. In particular he enforced the laws against
            extravagance, setting watchmen in various parts of the market, to seize and bring to him dainties which were
            exposed for sale in violation of the law; and sometimes he sent his lictors and soldiers to take from a
            dining-room any articles which had escaped the vigilance of his watchmen, even after they had been served.

            In particular, for the adornment and convenience of the city, also for the protection and extension of the
            Empire, he formed more projects and more extensive ones every day: first of all, to rear a temple of Mars,
            greater than any in existence, filling up and levelling the pool in which he had exhibited the sea-fight,
            and to build a theatre of vast size, sloping down from the Tarpeian rock; to reduce the civil code to
            fixed limits, and of the vast and prolix mass of statutes to include only the best and most essential in a
            limited number of volumes; to open to the public the greatest possible libraries of Greek and Latin books,
            assigning to Marcus Varro the charge of procuring and classifying them; to drain the Pomptine marshes; to
            let out the water from Lake Fucinus; to make a highway from the Adriatic across the summit of the Apennines
            as far as the Tiber; to cut a canal through the Isthmus; to check the Dacians, who had poured into Pontus
            and Thrace; then to make war on the Parthians by way of Lesser Armenia, but not to risk a battle with them
            until he had first tested their mettle.
            <br>
            All these enterprises and plans were cut short by his death. But before I speak of that, it will not
            be amiss to describe briefly his personal appearance, his dress, his mode of life, and his character, as
            well as his conduct in civil and military life.

        <h1>Ch XLV:</h1>
        <p>
            He is said to have been tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and
            keen black eyes; sound of health, except that towards the end he was subject to sudden fainting fits and to
            nightmare as well. He was twice attacked by the falling sicknes during his campaigns.
            <br> 
            He was somewhat overnice in the care of his person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having superfluous
            hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness was a disfigurement which troubled him greatly,
            since he found that it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because of it he used to comb
            forward his scanty locks from the crown of his head, and of all the honours voted him by the senate and
            people there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel
            wreath at all times. They say, too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's tunic43
            with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had a girdle over it, though rather a loose one;
            and this, they say, was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles to keep an eye on the
            ill-girt boy.
