                In the course of his sixteenth year he lost his father. In the next consulate, having previously been
                nominated priest of Jupiter, he broke his engagement with Cossutia, a lady of only equestrian rank, but
                very wealthy, who had been betrothed to him before he assumed the gown of manhood, and married Cornelia,
                daughter of that Cinna who was four times consul, by whom he afterwards had a daughter Julia;
                and the dictator Sulla could by no means force
                him to put away his wife. Therefore besides being punished by the loss of his priesthood,a his wife's
                dowry, and his family inheritances, Caesar was held to be one of the opposite party. He was accordingly
                forced to go into hiding, and though suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, to change from one
                covert to another almost every night, and save himself from Sulla's detectives by bribes.
                But at last, through the good offices of the Vestal virgins and of his near kinsmen,
                Mamercus Aemilius and Aurelius Cotta, he obtained forgiveness. 3 Everyone knows that when Sulla had long
                p5 held out against the most devoted and eminent men of his party who interceded for Caesar, and they
                obstinately persisted, he at last gave way and cried, either by divine inspiration or a shrewd forecast:
                "Have your way and take him; only bear in mind that the man you are so eager to save will one day deal
                the death blow to the cause of the aristocracy, which you have joined with me in upholding; for in this
                Caesar there is more than one Marius."

                He served his first campaign in Asia on the personal staff of Marcus Thermus, governor of the
                province. Being sent by Thermus to Bithynia, to fetch a fleet, he dawdled so long at the court of
                Nicomedes that he was suspected of improper relations with the king; and he lent colour to this scandal
                by going back to Bithynia a few days after his return, with the alleged purpose of collecting a debt for
                a freedman, one of his dependents. During the rest of the campaign he enjoyed a better reputation, and
                at the storming of Mytilene Thermus awarded him the civic crown.

                He served too under Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia, but only for a short time; for learning of the death
                of Sulla, and at the same time hoping to profit by a counter revolution which Marcus Lepidus was setting
                on foot, he hurriedly returned to Rome. But he did not make common cause with Lepidus, although he was
                offered highly favourable terms, through lack of confidence both in that leader's capacity and in the
                outlook, which he found less promising than he had expected.

                Then, after the civil disturbance had been quieted, he brought a charge of extortion against Cornelius
                Dolabella, an ex-consul who had been honoured with a triumph. On the acquittal of Dolabella Caesar
                determined to withdraw to Rhodes, to escape from the ill-will which he had incurred, and at the same
                time to rest and have leisure to study under Apollonius Molo, the most eminent teacher of oratory of
                that time. While crossing to Rhodes, after the winter season had already begun, he was taken by pirates
                near the island of Pharmacussa and remained in their custody for nearly forty days in a state of intense
                vexation, attended only by a single physician and two body-servants; for he had sent off his
                travelling companions and the rest of his attendants at the outset, to raise money for his ransom. Once
                he was set on shore on payment of fifty talents, he did not delay then and there to launch a fleet and
                pursue the departing pirates, and the moment they were in his power to inflict on them the punishment
                which he had often threatened when joking with them. He then proceeded to Rhodes, but as Mithridates
                was devastating the neighbouring regions, he crossed over into Asia, to avoid the appearance of inaction
                when the allies of the Roman people were in danger. There he levied a band of auxiliaries and drove the
                king's prefect from the province, thus holding the wavering and irresolute states to their allegiance.

                When quaestor, he pronounced the customary orations from the rostra in praise of his aunt Julia and his
                wife Cornelia, who had both died. And in the eulogy of his aunt he spoke in the following terms of her
                paternal and maternal ancestry and that of his own father: "The family of my aunt Julia is descended by
                her mother from the kings, and on her father's side is akin to the immortal Gods; for the Marcii Reges
                (her mother's family name) go back to Ancus Marcius, and the Julii, the family of which ours is a
                branch, to Venus. Our stock therefore has at once the sanctity of kings, whose power is supreme among
                mortal men, and the claim to reverence which attaches to the Gods, who hold sway over kings themselves."

                wife Cornelia, who had both died. And in the eulogy of his aunt he spoke in the following terms of her

                <br>
                In place of Cornelia he took to wife Pompeia, daughter of Quintus Pompeius and granddaughter of Lucius
                Sulla. But he afterward divorced her, suspecting her of adultery with Publius Clodius; and in fact the
                report that Clodius had gained access to her in woman's garb during a public religious ceremony was so
                persistent, that the senate decreed that the pollution of the sacred rites be judicially investigated.

                As quaestor it fell to his lot to serve in Further Spain. When he was there, while making the circuit of
                the assize-towns, to hold court under commission from the praetor, he came to Gades, and noticing a
                statue of Alexander the Great in the temple of Hercules, he heaved a sigh, and as if out of patience
                with his own incapacity in having as yet done nothing noteworthy at a time of life when Alexander
                had already brought the world to his feet, he straightway asked for his discharge, to grasp the first
                opportunity for greater enterprises at Rome. Furthermore, when he was dismayed by a dream the
                following night (for he thought that he had offered violence to his mother) the soothsayers inspired him
                with high hopes by their interpretation, which was: that he was destined to rule the world, since the
                mother whom he had seen in his power was none other than the earth, which is regarded as the common
                parent of all mankind.

                Departing therefore before his term was over, he went to the Latin colonies which were in a state of
                unrest and meditating a demand for citizenship;6 and he might have spurred them on to some rash act, had
                not the consuls, in anticipation of that very danger, detained there for a time the legions which had
                been enrolled for service in Cilicia.

                For all that he presently made a more daring attempt at Rome; for a few days before he entered upon his
                aedileship he was suspected of having made a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus, an ex-consul, and likewise
                with Publius Sulla and Lucius Autronius, who, after their election to the consulship, had been found
                guilty of corrupt practices. The design was to set upon the senate at the opening of the year and put to
                the sword as many as they thought good; then Crassus was to usurp the dictatorship, naming Caesar as his
                master of horse, and when they had organized the state according to their pleasure, the consulship was
                to be restored to Sulla and Autronius.

            <h1>Ch X:</h1>
            <p>
                When aedile, Caesar decorated not only the Comitium and the Forum with its adjacent basilicas, but the
                Capitol as well, building temporary colonnades for the display of a part of his material. He exhibited
                combats with wild beasts and stage-plays too, both with his colleague and independently. The result was
                that Caesar alone took all the credit even for what they spent in common, and his colleague Marcus
                Bibulus openly said that his was the fate of Pollux: "For," said he, "just as the temple erected in the
                Forum to the twin brethren, bears only the name of Castor, so the joint liberality of Caesar and myself
                is credited to Caesar alone." Caesar gave a gladiatorial show besides, but with somewhat fewer
                pairs of combatants than he had purposed; for the huge band which he assembled from all quarters so
                terrified his opponents, that a bill was passed limiting the number of gladiators which anyone was to be
                allowed to keep in the city.

            <h1>Ch XI:</h1>
            <p>
                Having won the goodwill of the masses, Caesar made an attempt through some of the tribunes to have the
                charge of Egypt given him by a decree of the commons, seizing the opportunity to ask for so irregular an
                appointment because the citizens of Alexandria had deposed their king, who had been named by the senate
                an ally and friend of the Roman people, and their action was generally condemned. He failed however
                because of the opposition of the aristocratic party; wishing therefore to impair their prestige in every
                way he could, he restored the trophies commemorating the victories of Gaius Marius over Jugurtha and
                over the Cimbri and Teutoni, which Sulla had long since demolished. Furthermore in conducting
                prosecutions for murder, he included in the number of murderers even those who had received moneys from
                the public treasury during the proscriptions for bringing in the heads of Roman citizens, although they
                were expressly exempted by the Cornelian laws.

                He also bribed a man to bring a charge of high treason against Gaius Rabirius, who some years before had
                rendered conspicuous service to the senate in repressing the seditious designs of the tribune Lucius
                Saturninus; and when he had been selected by lot to sentence the accused, he did so with such
                eagerness, that when Rabirius appealed to the people, nothing was so much in his favour as the
                bitter hostility of his judge.

                After giving up hope of the special commission, he announced his candidacy for the office of
                pontifex maximus, resorting to the most lavish bribery. Thinking on the enormous debt which he had thus
                contracted, he is said to have declared to his mother on the morning of his election, as she kissed him
                when he was starting for the polls, that he would never return except as pontifex. And in fact he so
                decisively defeated two very strong competitors (for they were greatly his superiors in age and rank),
                that he polled more votes in their tribes than were cast for both of them in all the tribes.

            <h1>Ch XIV:</h1>
            <p>
                When the conspiracy of Catiline was detected, and all the rest of the senate favoured inflicting the
                extreme penalty on those implicated in the plot, Caesar, who was now praetor elect, alone proposed that
                their goods be confiscated and that they be imprisoned each in a separate town. Nay, more, he inspired
                such fear in those who favoured severer measures, by picturing the hatred which the Roman commons would
                feel for them for all future time, that Decimus Silanus, consul elect, was not ashamed to give a milder
                interpretation to his proposal (since it would have been humiliating to change it) alleging that it had
                been understood in a harsher sense than he intended. Caesar would have prevailed too, for a number had
                already gone over to him, including Cicero, the consul's brother, had not the address of Marcus Cato
                kept the wavering senate in line. Yet not even then did he cease to delay the proceedings, but only when
                an armed troop of Roman knights that stood on guard about the place threatened him with death as he
                persisted in his headstrong opposition. They even drew their swords and made such passes at him that his
                friends who sat next him forsook him, while a few had much ado to shield him in their embrace or with
                their robes. Then, in evident fear, he not only yielded the point, but for the rest of the year kept
                aloof from the House.

                people touching the restoration of the Capitol, proposing a bill for turning over the commission to
                another. But he withdrew the measure, since he could not cope with the united opposition of the
                aristocrats, seeing that they had at once dropped their attendance on the newly elected consuls and
                hastily gathered in throngs, resolved on an obstinate resistance.
