            <p>
                Yet after all, his other actions and words so turn the scale, that it is thought that he abused his
                power and was justly slain. For not only did he accept excessive honours, such as an uninterrupted
                consulship, the dictatorship for life, and the censorship of public morals, as well as the forename
                Imperator, the surname of Father of his Country, a statue among those of the kings, and a raised couch
                in the orchestra; but he also allowed honours to be bestowed on him which were too great for mortal
                man: a golden throne in the House and on the judgment seat; a chariot and litter in the procession at
                the circus; temples, altars, and statues beside those of the gods; a special priest, an additional
                college of the Luperci, and the calling of one of the months by his name. In fact, there were no honours
                which he did not receive or confer at pleasure.
                <br>
                He held his third and fourth consulships in name only, content with the power of the dictatorship p101
                conferred on him at the same time as the consulships. Moreover, in both years he substituted two consuls
                for himself for the last three months, in the meantime holding no elections except for tribunes and
                plebeian aediles, and appointing praefects instead of the praetors, to manage the affairs of the city
                during his absence. When one of the consuls suddenly died the day before the Kalends of January, he gave
                the vacant office for a few hours to a man who asked for it. With the same disregard of law and
                precedent he named magistrates for several years to come, bestowed the emblems of consular rank on ten
                ex-praetors, and admitted to the House men who had been given citizenship, and in some cases
                half-civilised Gauls. He assigned the charge of the mint and of the public revenues to his own slaves,
                and gave the oversight and command of the three legions which he had left at Alexandria to a favourite
                of his called Rufio, son of one of his freedmen.

            <h1>Ch LXXVII:</h1>
            <p>
                No less arrogant were his public utterances, which Titus Ampius records: that the state was nothing, a
                mere name without body or form; that Sulla did not know his A. B. C. when he laid down his dictatorship;
                that men ought now to be more circumspect in addressing him, and to regard his word as law. So far did
                he go in his presumption, that when a soothsayer once reported direful inwards without a heart, he said:
                <br>
                "They will be more favourable when I wish it; it should not be regarded as a portent, if a beast has no
                heart."

            <h1>Ch LXVIII:</h1>
            <p>
                But it was the following action in particular that roused deadly hatred against him. When the Senate
                approached him in a body with many highly honorary decrees, he received them before the temple of
                Venus Genetrix without rising. Some think that when he attempted to get up, he was held back by
                Cornelius Balbus; others, that he made no such move at all, but on the contrary frowned angrily on Gaius
                Trebatius when he suggested that he should rise. And this action of his seemed the more intolerable,
                because when he himself in one of his triumphal processions rode past the benches of the tribunes, he
                was so incensed because a member of the college, Pontius Aquila, did not rise, that he cried: "Come
                then, Aquila, take back the republic from me, you tribune"; and for several days he would not make a
                promise to any one without adding, "That is, if Pontius Aquila will allow me."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter" id="ch-79">

            <h1>Ch LXXIX:</h1>
            <p>
                To an insult which so plainly showed his contempt for the Senate he added an act of even greater
                insolence; for at the Latin Festival, as he was returning to the city, amid the extravagant and
                unprecedented demonstrations of the populace, someone in the press placed on his statue a laurel wreath
                with a white fillet tied to it; and when Epidius Marullus and Caesetius Flavius, tribunes of the
                commons, gave orders that the ribbon be removed from the wreath and the man taken off to prison, Caesar
                sharply rebuked and deposed them, either offended that the hint at regal power had been received with so
                little favour, or, as he asserted, that he had been robbed of the glory of refusing it.
                <br>
                But from that time on he could not rid himself of the odium of having aspired to the title of monarch,
                although he
                replied to the commons, when they hailed him as king, "I am Caesar and no king," and at the
                Lupercalia, when the consul Antony several times attempted to place a crown upon his head as he
                spoke from the rostra, he put it aside and at last sent it to the Capitol, to be offered to Jupiter
                Optimus Maximus.
                <br>
                Nay, more, the report had spread in various quarters that he intended to move to Ilium or Alexandria,
                taking with him the resources of the state, draining Italy by levies, and leaving
                the charge of the city to his friends; also that at the next meeting of the Senate Lucius Cotta would
                announce as the decision of Fifteen, that inasmuch as it was written in the books of fate that the
                Parthians could be conquered only by a king, Caesar should be given that title.

            <h1>Ch LXXX:</h1>
            <p>
                It was this that led the conspirators to hasten in carrying out their designs, in order to avoid giving
                their assent to this proposal.
                Therefore the plots which had previously been formed separately, often by groups of two or three, were
                united in a general conspiracy, since even the populace no longer were pleased with present conditions,
                but both secretly and openly rebelled at his tyranny and cried out for defenders of their liberty. On
                the admission of foreigners to the Senate, a placard was posted:
                <br>
                "God bless the Commonwealth! let no
                one consent to point out the House to a newly made senator." The following verses too were sung
                everywhere:
                <br>
                "Caesar led the Gauls in triumph, led them to the senate house;
                Then the Gauls put off their breeches, and put on the laticlave."
                <br>
                When Quintus Maximus, whom he had appointed consul in his place for three months, was entering
                the theatre, and his lictor called attention to his arrival in the usual manner, a general shout was
                raised: "He's no consul!" At the first election after the deposing of Caesetius and Marullus, the
                tribunes, several votes were found for their appointment as consuls. Some wrote on the base of Lucius
                Brutus' statue:
                <br>
                "Oh, that you were still alive"
                <br>
                and on that of Caesar himself:
                <br>
                "First of all was Brutus consul, since he drove the kings from Rome;
                Since this man drove out the consuls, he at last is made our king."
                <br>
                More than sixty joined the conspiracy against him, led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus.
                At first they hesitated whether to form two divisions at the elections in the Campus Martius, so that
                while some hurled him from the bridge as he summoned the tribes to vote, the rest might wait below and
                slay him; or to set upon him in the Sacred Way or at the entrance to the theatre. When, however, a
                meeting of the Senate was called for the Ides of March in the Hall of Pompey, they readily gave that
                time and place the preference.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="ch-81">

        <h1>Ch LXXXI:</h1>
        <p>
            Now Caesar's approaching murder was foretold to him by unmistakable signs. A few months before, when the
            settlers assigned to the colony at Capua by the Julian Law were demolishing some tombs of great antiquity,
            to build country houses, and plied their work with the greater vigour because as they rummaged about they
            found a quantity of vases of ancient workmanship, there was discovered in a tomb, which was said to be that
            of Capys, the founder of Capua, a bronze tablet, inscribed with Greek words and characters to this
            purport:
            <br>
            "Whenever the bones of Capys shall be moved, it will come to pass that a son of Ilium shall be
            slain at the hands of his kindred, and presently avenged at heavy cost to Italy."
            <br>
            And let no one think this tale a myth or a lie, for it is vouched for by Cornelius Balbus, an intimate
            friend of Caesar.
            Shortly before his death, as he was told, the herds of horses which he had dedicated to the river Rubicon
            when he crossed it, and had let loose without a keeper, stubbornly refused to graze and wept copiously.
            Again, when
            he was offering sacrifice, the soothsayer Spurinna warned him to beware of danger, which would come not
            later than the Ides of March; and on the day before the Ides of that month a little bird called the
            king-bird flew into the Hall of Pompey with a sprig of laurel, pursued by others of various kinds from the
            grove hard by, which tore it to pieces in the hall. In fact the very night before his murder he dreamt now
            that he was flying above the clouds, and now that he was clasping the hand of Jupiter; and his wife
            Calpurnia thought that the pediment of their house fell, and that her husband was stabbed in her arms; and
            on a sudden the door of the room flew open of its own accord.
            <br>
            4 Both for these reasons and because of poor health he hesitated for a long time whether to stay at home and
            put off what he had planned to do in the senate; but at last, urged by Decimus Brutus not to disappoint the
            full meeting which had for some time been waiting for him, he went forth almost at the end of the fifth
            hour; and when a note revealing the plot was handed him by someone on the way, he put it with others
            which he held in his left hand, intending to read them presently.
            <br>
            Then, after several victims had been slain, and he could not get favourable omens, he entered the House in
            defiance of portents, laughing at
            Spurinna and calling him a false prophet, because the Ides of March were come without bringing him harm;
            though Spurinna replied that they had of a truth come, but they had not gone.

        <p>
            As he took his seat, the conspirators gathered about him as if to pay their respects, and straightway
            Tillius Cimber, who had assumed the lead, came nearer as though to ask something; and when Caesar with a
            gesture put him off to another time, Cimber caught his toga by both shoulders; then as Caesar cried, "Why,
            this is violence!" one of the Cascas stabbed him from one side just below the throat. Caesar caught
            Casca's arm and ran it through with his stylus, but as he tried to leap to his feet, he was stopped by
            another wound. When he saw that he was beset on every side by drawn daggers, he muffled his head in his
            robe, and at the same time drew down its lap to his feet with his left hand, in order to fall more decently,
            with the lower part of his body also covered.
            <br>
            And in this wise he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the
            first stroke, though some have written that when Marcus
            Brutus rushed at him, he said in Greek, "You too, my child?"
            <br>
            All the conspirators made off, and he lay there lifeless for some time, and finally three common slaves put
            him on a litter and carried him home, with
            one arm hanging down. And of so many wounds none turned out to be mortal, in the opinion of the
            physician Antistius, except the second one in the breast. The conspirators had intended after slaying him to
            drag his body to the Tiber, confiscate his property,
            and revoke his decrees; but they forebore through fear of Marcus Antonius the consul, and Lepidus, the
            master of horse.

            Then at the request of his father-in law, Lucius Piso, the will was unsealed and read in Antony's house,
            which Caesar had made on the preceding Ides of September at his place near Lavicum, and put in the care of
            the chief of the Vestals. Quintus Tubero states that from his first consulship until the beginning of the
            civil war it was his wont to write down Gnaeus Pompeius as his heir, and to read this to the assembled
            soldiers. In his last will, however, he named three heirs, his sisters' grandsons, Gaius Octavius, to
            three-fourths of his estate, and Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius to share the remainder. At the end of
            the will, too, he adopted Gaius Octavius into his family and gave him his name. He named several of his
            assassins among the guardians of his son, in case one should be born to him, and Decimus Brutus even among
            his heirs in the second degree. To the people he left his gardens near the Tiber for their common use and
            three hundred sesterces to each man.

        <h1>Ch LXXXIV:</h1>
        <p>
            When the funeral was announced, a pyre was erected in the Campus Martius near the tomb of Julia, and on the
            rostra a gilded shrine was placed, made after the model of the temple of Venus Genetrix; within was a couch
            of ivory with coverlets of purple and gold, and at its head a pillar hung with the robe in which he was
            slain. Since it was clear that the day would not be long enough for those who offered gifts, they were
            directed to bring them to the Campus by whatsoever streets of the city they wished, regardless of any order
            of precedence. At the funeral games, to rouse pity and indignation at his death, these words from the
            "Contest for the Arms" of Pacuvius were sung:
            <br>
            <br>
            "Saved I these men that they might murder me?"
            <br>
            <br>
            And words of like purport from the "Electra" of Atilius. Instead of a eulogy the consul Antonius caused a
            herald to recite the decree of the Senate in which it had voted Caesar all divine and human honours at once,
            and likewise the oath with which they had all pledged themselves to watch over his personal safety; to which
            he added a very few words of his own. The bier on the rostra was carried down into the Forum by
            magistrates and ex-magistrates; and while some were urging that it be burned in the temple of Jupiter on the
            Capitol, and others in the Hall of Pompey, on a sudden two beings with swords by their sides and
            brandishing a pair of darts set fire to it with blazing torches, and at once the throng of bystanders heaped
            upon it dry branches, the judgment seats with the benches, and whatever else could serve as an offering.
            <br>
            Then the musicians and actors tore off their robes, which they had taken from the equipment of his triumphs
            and put on for the occasion, rent them to bits and threw them into the flames, and the veterans of the
            legions the arms with which they had adorned themselves for the funeral; many of the women too, offered up
            the jewels which they wore and the amulets and robes of their children.
            <br>
            At the height of the public grief a throng of foreigners went about lamenting each after the fashion
            of his country, above all the Jews, who even flocked to the place for several successive nights.

            Immediately after the funeral the commons ran to the houses of Brutus and Cassius with firebrands, and after
            being repelled with difficulty, they slew Helvius Cinna when they met him, through a mistake in the name,
            supposing that he was Cornelius Cinna, who had the day before made a bitter indictment of Caesar and for
            whom they were looking; and they set his head upon a spear and paraded it about the streets. Afterwards they
            set up in the Forum a solid column of Numidian marble almost twenty feet high, and inscribed upon it, "To
            the Father of his Country." At the foot of this they continued for a long time to sacrifice, make vows, and
            settle some of their disputes by an oath in the name of Caesar.

        <p>
            Caesar left in the minds of some of his friends the suspicion that he did not wish to live longer and had
            taken no precautions, because of his failing health; and that therefore he neglected the warnings which came
            to him from portents and from the reports of his friends. Some think that it was because he had full trust
            in the last decree of the senators and their oath that he dismissed even the armed bodyguard of Spanish
            soldiers that formerly attended him.
            <br>
            Others, on the contrary, believe that he elected to expose himself
            once for all to the plots that threatened him on every hand, rather than to be always anxious and on his
            guard. Some, too, say that he was wont to declare that it was not so much to his own interest as to
            that of his country that he remain alive; he had long since had his fill of power and glory; but if aught
            befell him, the commonwealth would have no peace, but would be plunged in strife under much worse
            conditions.

            About one thing almost all are fully agreed, that he all but desired such a death as he met; for once when
            he read in Xenophon how Cyrus in his last illness gave directions for his funeral, he expressed his horror
            of such a lingering kind of end and his wish for one which was swift and sudden. And the day before his
            murder, in a conversation which arose at a dinner at the house of Marcus Lepidus, as to what manner of death
            was most to be desired, he had given his preference to one which was sudden and unexpected.

            He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was numbered among the gods, not only by a formal decree,
            but also in the conviction of the common people. For at the first of the games which his heir Augustus gave
            in honour of his apotheosis, a comet shone for seven successive days, rising about the eleventh hour, and
            was believed to be the soul of Caesar, who had been taken to heaven; and this is why a star is set upon the
            crown of his head in his statue.
            <br>
            It was voted that the hall in which he was slain be walled up, that the Ides of March be called the Day of
            Parricide, and that a meeting of the senate should never be called on that day.

            Hardly any of his assassins survived him for more than three years, or died a natural death. They were all
            condemned, and they perished in various ways — some by shipwreck, some in battle; some took their own lives
            with the self-same dagger with which they had impiously slain Caesar.
